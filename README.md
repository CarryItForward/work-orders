# Carry it Forward Work Orders

Carry it Forward's Work Orders app allows staff to create work orders on behalf
of people in the community. The goal is to digitize CiF's current paper work
order process, making data more easily retrievable and giving the team access to
more insights.

## Tech Stack

The Work Orders app uses React/Next.js with Material UI on the frontend, and
Firebase/Google Cloud Functions on the backend.
